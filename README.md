# Bayesian Models â€“ Final Project

This repository includes three Jupyter notebooks demonstrating practical Bayesian modeling techniques applied to different domains.

---

### 1. Gaussian Process Regression
Implements **Gaussian Process Regression** to model nonlinear relationships with uncertainty estimation.  
Includes kernel selection, posterior prediction visualization, and comparison with linear regression.  
Demonstrates understanding of **non-parametric Bayesian methods** and probabilistic inference.

---

### 2. Online Advertising (A/B Testing)
Applies **Bayesian A/B testing** to evaluate conversion rates between two ad campaigns.  
Builds binomial models with Beta priors, computes posterior distributions, and interprets campaign performance probabilistically.  
Showcases practical use of **Bayesian decision analysis** in marketing data.

---

### 3. Football Analysis
Uses **Bayesian hierarchical modeling** to estimate team strengths and goal-scoring rates.  
Incorporates Poisson likelihoods with team-level priors to capture variability between matches.  
Highlights proficiency in **hierarchical inference** and model comparison.

---

Together, these notebooks demonstrate hands-on experience in **Bayesian reasoning, probabilistic programming (PyMC), and data-driven decision-making**.
